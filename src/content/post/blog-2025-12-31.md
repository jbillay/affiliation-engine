But what makes AI-powered smart plugs so special, and which ones should you consider in 2024?

Unlike traditional smart plugs, AI-powered smart plugs use machine learning and predictive technology to optimize your home’s energy usage, automate devices, and even adapt to your daily routines.

AI smart plugs analyze your energy consumption patterns and suggest ways to reduce waste. For example, they can automatically turn off devices when not in use or adjust power settings to save electricity.

### **2. Voice & App Control**
With AI integration, you can control your smart plugs via voice commands or mobile apps. For instance, you can say, *"Hey Google, turn off the living room lights,"* and your smart plug will respond instantly.

### **3. Scheduled & Automated Routines**
Set up schedules to turn devices on/off at specific times. Some AI smart plugs even learn your habits and automate tasks without manual input.

Some AI-powered smart plugs come with security features like child locks, overload protection, and real-time energy monitoring to prevent electrical hazards.
