## Why the iPad Pro Stands Out

Apple has always been at the forefront of innovating tools for creatives, and the latest iPad Pro is no exception. Here’s what makes it a standout choice:

### **2. M2 Chip for Blazing-Fast Performance**

### **4. USB-C and Thunderbolt Connectivity**
Need more power? The iPad Pro now features **Thunderbolt connectivity**, allowing you to connect external displays, SSDs, and even high-speed storage solutions. This makes it a versatile tool for both work and play.
