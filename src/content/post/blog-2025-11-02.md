#### What Are AI-Powered Smart Plugs?

AI-powered smart plugs are intelligent outlets that connect to your home Wi-Fi (or another network) and allow you to control appliances remotely via a smartphone app or voice assistant. What sets them apart from traditional smart plugs is their ability to learn your habits, optimize energy usage, and even predict your needs.

These devices use **machine learning algorithms** to analyze your daily routines, such as when you turn on lights, adjust the thermostat, or use kitchen appliances. Over time, they adapt to your preferences, automating tasks for a seamless smart home experience.

#### Top Benefits of AI-Powered Smart Plugs
